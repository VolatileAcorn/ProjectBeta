Using ashley, create a movement / rendering component system
Look at UE4 camera component and movement component
We will have two update loops, render and update to decouple logic and rendering
Do some maths to work out how to update position based on velocity and also render
Build and renderer more than 1 entities using a texture component, position component and render entity system
